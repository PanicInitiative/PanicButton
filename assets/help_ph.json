It was created to meet the digital security and privacy needs of advocates and human rights defenders. Security in-a-box includes a How-to Booklet, which addresses a number of important digital security issues. It also provides a collection of Hands-on Guides, each of which includes a particular freeware or open source software tool, as well as instructions on how you can use that tool to secure your computer, protect your information or maintain the privacy of your Internet communication. </p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.frontlinedefenders.org/files/workbook_eng.pdf\">Frontline Defenders - Workbook on Security</a> </li></ul><p>Designed to raise awareness about security issues and to help human rights defenders consider how to mitigate threats. The workbook takes human rights defenders through the steps to producing a security plan - for individuals and for organisations. It follows a systematic approach for assessing their security situation and developing risk and vulnerability reduction strategies and tactics.</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.frontlinedefenders.org/manuals/protection\">Frontline Defenders - Protection Manual for Human Rights Defenders</a></li></ul><p>The purpose of this manual is to provide human rights defenders with information and tools to improve their understanding of security and protection. The manual topics include risk analysis, evaluating threats, preventing and reacting to attacks and developing security plans. It is the main handout for Front Line training on protection and security.</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.newtactics.org/resource/english-collection-tactics-book\">New Tactics in Human Rights Project</a></li></ul><p>This book, published by the Center for Victims of Torture, is a collection of 80 stories of successful tactics used for human rights work.  The stories come from all over the world and range from prevention tactics to intervention tactics, restorative tactics to those that building human rights cultures and institutions.</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.ruckus.org/downloads/RuckusSecurityCultureForActivists.pdf\">Ruckus - Security Culture for Activists</a></li></ul><p>A guide for activists to safeguard themselves against government and corporate surveillance.</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.apc.org/en/irhr/digital-security-first-aid-kit\">APC- Digital Security First Aid Kit</a></li></ul><p>This kit contains short guides for human rights defenders who find themselves in emergencies related to communication and digital security. While the kit does not provide exhaustive guidelines on how to respond to specific situations, it does suggest concrete steps, further resources and references to support groups to whom activists can turn to for further assistance.</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://cpj.org/reports/2012/04/journalist-security-guide.php\">CPJ - Journalist Security Guide</a></li></ul><p>This guide details what journalists need to know in a new and changing world. It outlines basic preparedness for journalists taking on their first assignments around the world, offers refresher information for mid-career journalists returning to the field, and provides advice on complex issues such as digital security and threat assessment for journalists of all experience levels.</p>",

All SMS messages may be recorded by the service provider, and may be read by the strong adversaries.</li><li>When you need to communicate something that is sensitive, consider creating a coded system with trusted colleagues. For example, “X” could mean you’re in danger, and “Z” could mean you’re safe. “Tree” could mean you want to meet up. “Banner” could be a cafe you can meet at.&quot;</li><li>If you or your source are threatened, and you must communicate via SMS, you should both use an encrypted SMS application. If it is really sensitive information, it is better to find an alternative method to communicate and even avoid digital communications if possible. </li><li>If possible, carry more than one phone and ensure that at least one is anonymous so that sensitive communications cannot be tied to your personal identity. This means not registering the SIM card to yourself and using pre-paid phones that do not require you to give personal details or billing information to your network provider.</li><li>If possible, carry more than one phone and ensure that at least one is anonymous so that sensitive communications cannot be tied to your personal identity. Try not to register the SIM card to yourself and use pre-paid phones that do not require personal details or billing information.</li><li>Never keep a record of your SMS messages on your phone. However, it is good to be aware that even if you delete your messages, they may still be accessed by strong adversaries if they go directly to your service provider.</li><li>Where possible, memorize the telephone numbers of close colleagues or sources so that this information is not easily found on your telephone. Remember to delete numbers this in your call history although this information could still be found by going to the service provider.</li></ul><p>SOURCE: This list of top tips was taken and adapted from the Story Maker App Lessons on mobile security.
